# Security

I spent twenty years breaking into systems for a living, so this file is short and honest.

**The model:** one bearer token you invent, on an account you own. The token gates chat, intake, MCP, and export. It rides in your MCP URL because chat clients can't set headers — that's a documented tradeoff, not an accident. Treat the URL as a credential. Rotating `DEMO_TOKEN` in your Cloudflare dashboard kills the old URL instantly and costs your data nothing. Memories marked `secret` never leave through recall — that rule is bound into the query, not written in a doc and hoped about.

**Found something?** Tell me privately first: open a [GitHub security advisory](../../security/advisories/new) on this repo. I'll respond fast, credit you fully if you want credit, and ship the fix before we talk about it in public. No bounty program — just a builder who takes reports seriously and says thank you like he means it.

**Out of scope:** your own deployed copy's configuration (your account, your keys), and the upstream platforms (Cloudflare, model providers) — report those to their owners.
