/**
 * setup — the two failure modes a fresh deploy-button install can hit, made
 * impossible to hit silently. Born from a live doubt ("honestly I doubt you
 * smoke tested this") that was correct: the worker was smoke-tested, the
 * stranger's install path was not.
 *
 * 1. ensureSchema(): a fresh D1 has no tables if the deploy flow didn't run
 *    migrations. Rather than 500 at minute six of the ten-minute path, the
 *    consolidated schema (all migrations, final shape) is applied lazily —
 *    every statement idempotent, so it costs one cheap no-op batch on a DB
 *    that's already set up.
 *
 * 2. tokenIsDefault(): shipping a plaintext placeholder token means every
 *    installer who misses it shares one publicly-known key. The worker
 *    refuses to operate on the default — fail closed, with the exact fix
 *    printed where the person is standing.
